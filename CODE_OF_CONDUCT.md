## Scope
This Code applies to all project spaces and interactions: repositories, issues/PRs, Discussions, reviews, documentation, chats, events, and private communications initiated in the context of the project. It also applies when an individual publicly represents the project.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- **Primary contact (Confidential):** **AUSP59** <alanursapu@gmail.com>
- If the report involves the primary contact or you prefer otherwise, escalate to any maintainer listed in `CODEOWNERS` or open a private moderation request via GitHub (“Report content”) referencing this Code.

When reporting, include: what happened, where/when, participants, links or screenshots, and whether you need anonymity. We will confirm receipt and keep information on a need-to-know basis.

## Enforcement Process
The maintainers will follow a consistent, documented process:

1. **Acknowledge** receipt within **48 hours** (business days).
2. **Assess** severity, potential harm, and conflict of interest; recuse where appropriate.
3. **Investigate** by reviewing evidence and, if needed, privately contacting parties.
4. **Decide & Act** based on the Community Impact Guidelines (below).
5. **Communicate** outcome to involved parties; document minimally and keep records confidential.

### Community Impact Guidelines (non-exhaustive)
- **Level 1 – Correction:** Private or public clarification; aim to educate and unblock.
- **Level 2 – Warning:** Private written warning; conditions for continued participation.
- **Level 3 – Temporary Restrictions:** Time-bound removal from some or all spaces.
- **Level 4 – Ban:** Indefinite removal from all project spaces; potential revocation of roles.
- **Content Actions:** Edit/lock/hide/remove content that violates this Code.

## Principles & Safeguards
- **Confidentiality:** We keep reporter identity confidential unless explicit consent is given or required by law.
- **No Retaliation:** Retaliation against reporters, witnesses, or enforcers is prohibited and will be sanctioned.
- **Bad-Faith Reports:** Knowingly false or malicious reports are themselves violations.
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Any maintainer named or closely connected to an incident must recuse from handling it.
- **Proportionality:** Actions will be proportionate to impact and history; reinstatement is possible after demonstrated improvement.

## Appeals
If you believe an action was taken in error or is disproportionate, you may appeal in writing within **14 days** to **AUSP59** <alanursapu@gmail.com>. A different, unbiased maintainer (or an external advisor if available) will review the appeal.
